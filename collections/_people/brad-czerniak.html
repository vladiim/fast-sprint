<p>
  Brad is a known quantity.
</p>

<p>
  He worked pretty much non-stop for a decade-and-a-half, then took a couple months off in 2020.
  Brad thinks weird thoughts and expresses them, and sometimes does semi-strange things, but is overwhelmingly chill.
  Often you can find him doing bar trivia with friends or having a quick dinner out with Shelby before getting back
  home where the TV and snacks are. He makes websites and says nice things about libraries and Detroit.
