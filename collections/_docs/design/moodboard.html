<p><strong>Promise</strong>: We make the least-breakable widgets on the market in the Peoria area.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong>: Take the Chicagoland area's widget market by storm in the next five years.</p>

<p><strong>Tone</strong>: Direct, concise, uncomplicated. You should get what we're saying the first time you read it.</p>

<p><strong>Elevator pitch</strong>: "You know when you're up on the top floor trying to install a widget, and it breaks?
  Yeah, we've dealt with that forever, too. Our company makes widgets that don't break, so you pay less and get more."</p>

<p>Worked through 8 concepts, which seems like the right number to really explore the creative space. Each concept is
  a black-and-white rendering, since the end result has to be used for web, print (including b&amp;w), and other media.</p>

<p>A logo mark should accomplish a few things:</p>

<ul class="text-align--left">
  <li>Be quickly recognizable</li>
  <li>Hint at what the brand is for</li>
  <li>Not look cheesy, trendy, trashy, or otherwise negative</li>
  <li>Be able to be printed in black-and-white as well as full-color</li>
  <li>Allow placement in prominent ways like signage</li>
  <li>Allow placement in tiny places like tab icons</li>
  <li>Ideally be a bit clever</li>
</ul>

{% include atoms/heading.html

<p>Color plays a big part in bringing a brand together. Here is the palette of the base scheme, right next to each
  other. If you can't feel a brand impression or at least get a hint at a mood, it might be worthwhile to revisit the
  scheme.</p>

<ul class="list-style--none layout--multiple--horizontal">
  <li class="flex--1">
    <div class="palette background-color--main color--white font-family--monospace text-align--center display--flex
          flex-direction--column justify-content--center">
      {{ site.data.design-tokens.root.color.color.main.value }}
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="flex--1">
    <div class="palette background-color--second color--white font-family--monospace text-align--center display--flex
          flex-direction--column justify-content--center">
      {{ site.data.design-tokens.root.color.color.second.value }}
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="flex--1">
    <div class="palette background-color--third color--white font-family--monospace text-align--center display--flex
          flex-direction--column justify-content--center">
      {{ site.data.design-tokens.root.color.color.third.value }}
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="flex--1">
    <div class="palette background-color--accent color--white font-family--monospace text-align--center display--flex
          flex-direction--column justify-content--center">
      {{ site.data.design-tokens.root.color.color.accent.value }}
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Often the brand palette is used more subtly, via the light versions of the brand shades. These washed-out or pastel
  tones should also work together to give you a hint of the brand:</p>

<ul class="list-style--none layout--multiple--horizontal">
  <li class="flex--1">
    <div class="palette background-color--main-light font-family--monospace text-align--center display--flex
          flex-direction--column justify-content--center">
      {{ site.data.design-tokens.root.color.color.main-light.value }}
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="flex--1">
    <div class="palette background-color--second-light font-family--monospace text-align--center display--flex
          flex-direction--column justify-content--center">
      {{ site.data.design-tokens.root.color.color.second-light.value }}
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="flex--1">
    <div class="palette background-color--third-light font-family--monospace text-align--center display--flex

<p>A card is usually a good example of a site's mood, since it often has the site's choices of shadows (lighting direction),

<p>Here are the individual properties, highlighted for review:</p>

<p class="border--default padding-horizontal--4 padding-vertical--4">Along with the standard typographic styles demonstrated
  in the section below, this paragraph has the default border on it. It also has some padding applied, since otherwise
  the border would be tight to the text.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">border--default:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.border.border.default.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

<p class="border--default border-radius--default padding-horizontal--4 padding-vertical--4">This paragraph is similar
  to the one above, but it applies the standard amount of corner rounding for the site. In broad terms, very square
  corners feel calculated, structural, rigid, whereas a very round corner feels smooth, safe, playful. A subtle rounding
  in between can evoke a compromise between two extremes.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">border-radius--default:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.border-radius.border-radius.default.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

{% include atoms/spacer.html size="4" %}

<p class="border--default border-radius--default box-shadow--default padding-horizontal--4 padding-vertical--4">Here
  we add the default box-shadow. Even if a site doesn't explicitly use shadows (ie. flat design), setting a default has
  value because it gives a design idea of a light source and its direction. This can be used for art direction, and can
  contribute to imagery choice; keeping consistent lighting direction can make a site feel cohesive.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">box-shadow--default:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.box-shadow.box-shadow.default.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

{% include atoms/spacer.html size="4" %}

<div class="border--default background-color--second-light text-align--justify padding-horizontal--4 padding-vertical--4">
  <p>This box demonstrates how wide a box will go within the content area. Within reason, a narrow content area feels legible
    and cozy, while a wide area feels creative and expansive. We typically set up a 1200-pixel-wide content area, for two
    good reasons:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A 13-inch laptop usually has the equivalent of a 1280-pixel width, so 1200 gives some breathing room in regular
      conditions</li>
    <li>The standard image specification for the site, based on Facebook's social share image spec, is 1200x630. At a
      1200-pixel content area width, we can format all our images consistently and they'll take up their allotment</li>
  </ol>

  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">layout--content-area:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.layout.layout.content-area.value }}</strong></dfn>
</div>

{% include atoms/spacer.html size="4" %}

<p>The standard spacing on the site is multiples of a single,set value. This way, if you end up wanting to change the
  feel of the site, you can do it by changing one thing in one place. A site with big whitespace feels luxurious and
  upmarket, while tight spacing feels efficient but can also come across as unrefined. Here is a single space, not very
  indicative of much on its own:
  <br />
  <div class="display--inline-block background-color--accent padding-vertical--1 padding-horizontal--1"></div>
  <br />
  We set the spacing based relatively on the root font-size, which is almost always 16px.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">spacing--single:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.spacing.spacing.single.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

{% include atoms/spacer.html size="4" %}

<p>Motion, transitions, animations, and 'micro-animations' (which is industry buzzword talk rather than a meaningful
  distinction) can also influence how a visitor feels about your brand presence. An example of the default transition
  timing is below:</p>

<button>Hover this for a transition example</button>

{% include atoms/spacer.html size="2" %}

<p>Human perception and preference for snappy interfaces constrains transitions to between instant and half a second.
  Obviously you can't make a transition faster than instant, and any slower than half a second and people feel like
  there's a computer problem.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">transition--default:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.transition.transition.default.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

{% include atoms/heading.html
children="Typography"
classes="text-align--center"
level="3"
%}

<p>Below are textual explanations of the typographic choices, as well as some samples of common elements. This is what
  normal body text looks like, for instance.</p>

{% include atoms/heading.html
  children="Heading 2 begins a section"
  classes="text-align--center"
  level="2"
%}

<p>Following a heading should be some text. If there's a heading and then another heading it's usually a sign that the
  content isn't being outlined in a manner that humans of all abilities as well as search engines can easily understand.</p>

{% include atoms/heading.html
  children="Level-3 headings are most common within text passages"
  classes=""
  level="3"
%}

<p>A level-1 heading is often the page title. Depending on your school of thought, the logo may also be a level-1 heading.
  Level-2 headings are for section headers. So once you've gotten into a section and are writing text, you're using third-level
  headings to keep the right outline level.</p>

<p>There should be a comfortable amount of space between paragraphs. Not a tiny space that makes it feel like a continuous
  paragraph, nor a giant space that makes the page feel like a void.</p>

<p>Anyway, level three headings, as a common text treatment within body text, should appear distinct from the paragrpah
  text, but should be legible and easy to visually discern when skimming or scanning.</p>

{% include atoms/heading.html
  children="Level 4 is the last practical heading level"
  classes=""
  level="4"
%}

<p>In practice, a document written for humans on the web doesn't go down six outline levels. If you find yourself writing
  a fifth-level heading, it may be time to reconsider the density and complexity of the page. It might be worthwhile to
  write simpler prose and split different concepts onto different pages.</p>

{% include atoms/heading.html
  children="Alas, Level 5 exists"
  classes=""
  level="5"
%}

<p>More often than not, the type scale approaches the body text size around heading level 5 or 6. It's not uncommon for
  heading level six to be smaller than body text, albeit bold or italic or underlined or a different font or a different
  shade/color. If you're writing a dense, technical site, it's probably worthwhile to keep heading 5 bigger than body
  text.</p>

{% include atoms/heading.html
  children="Might as well be creative with heading level 6"
  classes=""
  level="6"
%}

<p>An important thing to note with heading levels, beyond font size and text treatments, it the comfort of the spacing
  between a heading and text, especially above it. A consistent amount of space between all text elements including headings
  is similar to square corners: harsh, calculating, flat. A variable amount of space (bigger headings have bigger spaces)
  feels more human and organic.</p>

<p>Here are the fonts used to evoke brand feelings and aid the user in reading the site.</p>

<p class="font-family--primary">This paragraph probably looks like the once above it. That's because paragraphs are
  overwhelmingly set in the primary font. The web is a majority of sans-serif faces for the body copy, but a serif can
  give a classic, timeless feel.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">font-family--primary:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.font-family.font-family.primary.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

<p class="font-family--secondary">Here is some body text set in the secondary font. Depending on the face being used,
  this may not be particularly easy-to-read. The secondary font is for making a statement in your headings and other
  places where feeling can be generated with text treatment. See in the definition box that the main font is declared,
  but then there's a 'stack' of web-safe fonts separated by commas. These are the fallbacks for when the web font doesn't
  load. You can also use them as secondary brand fonts.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">font-family--secondary:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.font-family.font-family.secondary.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

{% include atoms/heading.html
  children="Secondary font in realistic example"
  classes="font-family--secondary"
  level="2"
%}

<p class="font-family--monospace">If your site has code samples, having a monospace font can be a good, subtle branding
  enhancement. Typically we'll just set a web-safe stack, but if you have a technical site you'll likely see a benefit
  picking and loading a brand-specific code font.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">font-family--monospace:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.font-family.font-family.monospace.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

<code class="font-family--monospace"><pre>
  // Here is some code as an example, set in monospace font:
  console.log({
    fontName: 'test1',
    sillyCode: 'what the heck?'
  });
</pre></code>

<p class="font-family--input">Text boxes and other form inputs can have their own font, and on this site it is set to
  this! For the most part you're gonna want to stick to a boring sans-serif font for form inputs, since that's what
  users expect.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">font-family--input:

<p class="line-height--default">This paragraph has the standard line-height (leading) applied. A value of 1 means the
  text is strictly single-spaced. A value of 2 is double-spaced. In practical terms text feels legible when it's a little
  less than 1.5. You can make the text feel urgent and dense by going lower, or breezy by going higher.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">line-height--default:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.line-height.line-height.default.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

<p class="line-height--heading">This is probably more difficult to read. Body text can be nearly double-spaced and it
  still feels pretty comfortable. Headings with more than about 1.2 spacing begin to subvert the proportions of space.
  In order to preserve the gestalt of the heading's logical text grouping, text with a line-height for headings should
  be nearly single-spaced.
  <br />
  <dfn class="background-color--grey-dark color--white font-family--monospace">line-height--heading:
    <strong>{{ site.data.design-tokens.root.line-height.line-height.heading.value }}</strong></dfn>
</p>

<p class="text-shadow--default">Text shadows are not typically applied to body text because it is so small, and the
  shadows can interfere with the shapes of letters and words when reading. But headings, especially those placed over
  image backgrounds, can benefit from a little shadow or glow, especially when a brand mood appreciates depth and lighting
  over flatness.
  <br />
