<p>@todo for some reason this page is running into rendering issues.</p>

<p>
  Section entities may be called by <code>organisms/section.html</code> using the mode="ref" prop. They can also be automatically
  added to any content in the Page collection via the front-matter.
</p>

{% for section in site.sections %}
  {{ section }}
  {% include atoms/spacer.html size="8" %}
{% endfor %}
