<p>
  Personas, as used in UX, are useful for testing and heuristics where <em>empathizing with the motivations</em> of a particular
  user or segment could yield insights about the IA and UI of a site or app. The following personas are applicable to a wide
  range of applications.

<p>
  Barry is a 65-year-old from a rural area. He's curious, deliberate, and prefers things kind of slow. His primary behavior
  on websites is <strong>skimming and browsing</strong>. He's likely to peruse 5 or more pages on the site before bouncing,
  read some passages in depth, and eschew the search functionality in preference to the navigation and other information scents.

<p>
  Stephanie is 24, a Sagittarius, lives in a suburb, and works in the city. She grew up with the internet, and is not inclined
  to waste time. She got to the site from a search engine, will use site search to narrow and refine results, and will even
  <code>Ctrl+F</code> on pages to find what she's looking for. She's more likely to bounce quickly, but may return to a
  different page via organic.
