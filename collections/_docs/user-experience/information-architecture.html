{% include atoms/heading.html

<p>
  Menus are a good indication of the implied structure of a site, even when the typed data is stored in a flat manner.
</p>

{% include atoms/heading.html
  children="Main"
  classes=""
  level="4"
%}

<p>The main menu is the primary way users navigate between top-level sections. Pages in the main menu should have short,
  instantly-understandable titles. There should be between 1 and 7 main menu items, including the home page.</p>

{% include molecules/menu.html
  classes=""
  menu="main"
%}

{% include atoms/heading.html
  children="Footer"
  classes=""
  level="4"
%}

<p>More often than not, the footer menu is a duplicate of the main menu. If there is an important but secondary page that
  does not fit in the main menu or elsewhere, the footer menu could be the place for it, tentatively. It's a good place to
  park a page in order to resolve an argument.</p>

{% include molecules/menu.html
  classes=""
  menu="footer"
%}

{% include atoms/heading.html
children="Utility"
classes=""
level="4"
%}

<p>The utility menu is where to put 'verb' items; if the main menu has nouns like 'About' or 'Products', then the utility
  menu would be best for 'Contact us' or 'Schedule an appointment'. Overall, the utility menu is a great place for contact
  information.</p>

{% include molecules/menu.html
classes=""
menu="utility"
%}

{% include atoms/heading.html
children="Copyright"
classes=""
level="4"
%}

<p>The copyright menu holds legal and technical documentation links. This is stuff you have to have, but not that anybody
  clicks into with any regularity.</p>

{% include molecules/menu.html
classes=""
menu="copyright"
%}

{% include atoms/spacer.html size="8" %}

{% include atoms/heading.html
  children="Collections"
  classes=""
  level="3"
%}

<p>The site's content can be put into the following buckets for use throughout:</p>

<ul>
  {% for collection in site.collections %}
    <li>{{ collection.label }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

{% include atoms/spacer.html size="8" %}

{% include atoms/heading.html
children="Taxonomy"
classes=""
level="3"
%}

<p>All content on the site can be described (for keyword SEO purposes) and grouped together using two different vocabularies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Categories</strong> for broad, structured description</li>
  <li><strong>Tags</strong> for free-form description</li>
</ul>
