## Vision, mission, values, goals & objectives

The following strategic direction encompasses the strategy of this site _qua_ website; that is, it is a website strategy
rather than an organization strategy. The vision, mission, values, goals, and objectives herein define what is to be
accomplished by the site _in service_ of a greater organizational vision.

### Vision

A site where everyone can find what they need quickly.

### Mission

To deliver a broadly-accessible and inclusive web experience that is efficient and feels fast, using compelling copy,
media, and web-standards-based technologies.

### Values

#### What we value

1. **Reusable**: if you can keep things general so you don't have to rewrite or even tweak it next time, do that!
2. **Empathetic**: the team is the product, and the team needs to think always of the user
3. **Brief**
4. **Consistent**: one pattern per solution, less one-off stuff and mixed metaphors
5. **Understandable**: plain language, plenty of documentation, nothing _too_ clever
6. **Standard**: avoid overbuilt frameworks and abstractions in favor of 'vanilla' solutions

#### What we avoid

1. **Dishonesty**: don't plagiarize and always cite your sources
2. **Window-dressing**: we don't design for design's sake, and we don't remove focus outlines just for the aesthetic
3. **Bleeding**: the hot newness will still exist after the other guy has gotten the bugs out
4. **Perfection**: real artists ship

### Goals and objectives

1. **Inclusive, accessible, usable design** that respects our users' wishes
   - Zero errors reported on any tested page via Lighthouse or WAVE
   - One-week or faster turnaround on repairing any reported accessibility issues
2. **Blazing front-end performance** that improves conversions and SEO, works for slow connections, and reduces hardware costs
   - Lighthouse performance tests always over 90%
   - Conversion improvement over time via _user tests_ rather than CRO/A-B tests
   - Reduced mobile bounce rate
3. **Users don't need to contact support** because the information was right there on the site and easy to find and understand
   - Fewer client support contacts year-over-year
4. **Demonstrable journey paths for all personas**, and no cheating by deleting personas
   - Prominent, clear, easy-to-use main navigation that reflects the core Information Architecture
   - Snappy and effective search for information foraging
   - Well-written, simple, skimmable content that doesn't make _Steve Krug_ think
