<p>
  In order to ensure snappy and standards-compliant front-end performance, each asset group should be limited to the
  following maximum numbers of files and total payload.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Asset class</th>
    <th>Max number of files</th>
    <th>Total payload size</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for size in site.data.budget[0].resourceSizes %}
      {% assign i = forloop.index | minus: 1 %}
      <tr>
        <td>{{ size.resourceType }}</td>
        <td>{{ site.data.budget[0].resourceCounts[i].budget }}</td>
        <td>{{ size.budget }} kB</td>
      </tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  The above data comes from <code>./_data/budget.json</code>, which is a performance budget file that can be directly
  used <a href="https://web.dev/use-lighthouse-for-performance-budgets/">by the Lighthouse CLI</a> to test pages against
  the budget.
</p>

<p>
  If editing the budget.json file, please ensure to keep the asset classes in both <code>resourceCounts</code> and
  <code>resourceSizes</code> identical and in the same (alphabetical) order, since the way this table is rendered efficiently
  depends on that.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
  Front-end performance is important, as reflected in this site's strategic plan. Performance affects multiple aspects of
  site operation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters">User visits and marketing conversions</a></li>
  <li>Server and bandwidth costs</li>
  <li>Usability on mobile, low-power, and slow-connection devices</li>
  <li>Brand perception</li>
</ul>

<p>
  As a website team, it is our duty to keep site front-end performance within the budget whenever humanly possible. When
  we are in jeopardy of exceeding the budget, we can approach the issue in one or more ways
  (<a href="https://24ways.org/2012/responsive-responsive-design/#targetText=Create%20a%20culture%20of%20performance">according to Tim Kadlec</a>):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Optimize an existing feature or asset on the page</li>
  <li>Remove an existing feature or asset from the page</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t add the new feature or asset</li>
  <li><del>Remove useful content instead</del></li>
</ol>

<p>
  Great performance sometimes means making tough choices, but as a team we will prevail as long as we remain goal-oriented.
</p>
