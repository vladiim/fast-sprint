#### General guidance

Headings provide your document with an hierarchical outline.

  * Avoid skipping heading levels: always start from `<h1>`, next use `<h2>` and so on
  * You should only use one `<h1>` per page. Using more than one will not result in an error, but using only one is seen
    as a best practice. It makes logical sense â€” `<h1>` is the most important heading, and tells you what the purpose of the
    overall page is. You wouldn't have a book with more than one title, or a movie with more than one name! Having a single
    top-level title is also arguably better for screenreader users, and SEO

{% capture accessibility %}
A common navigation technique for users of screen reading software is jumping from heading to heading to quickly determine
the content of the page. Because of this, it is important to not skip one or more heading levels. Doing so may create confusion,
as the person navigating this way may be left wondering where the missing heading is.
